# 🧠 My Second Brain - Obsidian Knowledge Vault

Welcome to my personal knowledge management system! This is my **Second Brain** - a curated collection of notes, insights, and learning materials built using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

## 🤔 What is a Second Brain?

A **Second Brain** is a personal knowledge management system that serves as an extension of your biological memory. It's based on the concept popularized by Tiago Forte in his book "Building a Second Brain" (BASB).

### 🎯 Core Principles
- **📥 Capture** - Collect valuable information from various sources
- **🔗 Connect** - Link ideas and create meaningful relationships between concepts  
- **🎨 Create** - Use stored knowledge to generate new insights and solutions
- **📚 Curate** - Continuously refine and organize information for easy retrieval

Instead of trying to remember everything, a Second Brain allows you to:
- **Offload cognitive burden** from your mind
- **Build upon previous learning** through connected notes
- **Discover unexpected insights** through serendipitous connections
- **Create a lasting knowledge asset** that grows over time
